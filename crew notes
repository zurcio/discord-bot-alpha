crew
when players reach Sector 3, they unlock !crew
the number of crew a player can hire will depend on their sector - 1 additional crew member per sector from sector 3 (so max number of pets = 4-player(sector))


obtain crew
crew can be 'hired' when they appear after a command (~3% chance of appearing, unless a player is at their max number of crew - in which case, none will appear)
this crew member will appear with a 'salary demand' and a 'benefits demand'
each will have a randomly generated limit: 'salary demand' will be maximum 5000 scrap, 'benefits' will be maximum 5 medkits
players can offer scrap or medkits, up to 6 total
scrap offers will be 1000 at a time, medkits are 1 at a time
when a crew appears, players will be prompted to write a string of these offers:
-example "an applicant appears! this crew demands a salary of {4000 scrap} and benefits of {2 medkits}! give salary or benefits to hire the crew with 'scrap' or 'med'! you have 15 seconds before the crew accepts another job offer"
-player response: "scrap scrap scrap med med med" (+3000 scrap, +3 medkit)
-crew demands reduced to 1000 scrap salary and 0 medkits (in this example, player over-offered benefits and under-offered salary)
-some calculation happens for a percent chance of hiring this crew member based on the result. if the demands are fully met, the crew is hired. if the offers are below the demands, this calculation occurs.
-player could write in any order, as long as the inputs are valid (e.g. "scrap med scrap med scrap" is valid, but "scrapmed scrap scrap" would not be because of the missing space)
-the amount of salary and benefits the player offers is how much it will cost to send that crew on jobs

crew types
-scan - crew has type 'soldier'
-work - crew has type 'contractor'
-research - crew has type 'scientist'
-explore - crew has type 'explorer'

types will give certain benefits to various crew jobs or commands

crew jobs
players pay crew salary for them do to a job, determined by the hire process when they first appeared
!crew job [id] 
the crew returns with a result based on their type
soldiers can find scrap
contractors can find material resources
scientists can find xp and lootboxes
explorers can find scrap and enemy drops (same drop chance as player, based on number of encounters)



unlocking and capacity
-gate command at sector >= 3
-no cap on crew capacity; players have 'crew slots', starting with 1 at sector 3 and one additional for each sector thereafter
-crew persists through sector travel

data model
-crew should have simple internal ids for the player to use in !crew job: A, B, C, etc. at Z, wrap to AA, AB, AC, etc. and so on thereafter
-type, salary demand, benefits demand (set upon crew hire)
-jobs will take time (~4 hours each job)
-agreed on other notes, no additional

spawn and hiring flow
-payment on hire happens immediately and upon every job send
-agreed on other notes, no additional

commands and UX
-good !crew notes
-love the "rename" idea - this also implies each crew should spawn with a name
-no dismissal mechanic for now, but we could consider a !crew retrain mechanic to try for a new type later on down the line
-no notes on !crew job
-at this time, all crew can be sent on jobs with a cooldown applied to each crew 
 -considering locking crew job sends to one crew, unless they have a particular attribute i haven't considered yet_
 -if we implement a system of upgrading crew, perhaps at x level they can send multiple crew on jobs at once (e.g. all crew at max level can be sent on jobs, with an additional crew below max level)

rewards, balance, and costs
-outputs should be tied to planet and sector, ignore other multipliers
-crew job as stated above will have 4 hour cooldown
-rewards should return at the end of the cooldown: crew does job, player checks !crew at the end of 4 hours and gains rewards
-no other notes on this section

integrations and interfaces
-respect double-drop effects when applicable
-do not apply to quests
-as stated above, crew persists through sectors. additional note on sector travel for clarity, if crew are on a job during sector travel, that should also persist

persistence and migration
-no notes

error handling and edge cases
-agreed, truncate more than 6 tokens (ignore all after 6)
-when deducting resources on hire, if a player lacks the resources they offered, the offer limits to the amount they're able to offer (max out at the players' amounts)

testing
-can add a test to admin_tools.py to force a spawn of crew for testing purposes
-please add unit tests!

open questions
-answered above, crew capacity is infinite, just starts at sector 3 with 1 crew capacity and increases by 1 for each sector travel
-answered above, offers are consumed upon hire in addition to being the requirements for that crew's jobs after
-answered above, crew persist through sector travel
-answered above, crew job duration is 4 hours with rewards given at the end of the job. that should act as the cooldown.
-medkit key as it is in players.json inventory and items.json list
